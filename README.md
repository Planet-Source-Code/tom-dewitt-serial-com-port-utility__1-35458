### Description

(Post hack Re-Submit)

This is a serial port communication utility that allows the control

of the properties of the MSComm object. It includes a simulated oscilloscope

display of the data waveform received by the port. It is still in its development

stage and is not very robust code as the project was just somethng I threw

together to check the communication to a PLC, but our engineeers wanted

more. I am looking for input from other programmers as to there likes and

dislikes so any input would be greatly appreciated. I submitted this before

but was "hacked" by some useless person.
